    "    A linear regression model that uses regularization\n",

    "Explanation: Lasso Regression is a linear regression model that uses regularization to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty term to the cost function that encourages the model to use fewer features. This penalty term is based on the L1 norm of the model coefficients.\n",

    "What is the purpose of Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "     To maximize the R-squared value of the model\n",

    "Explanation: The regularization parameter is a hyperparameter of Lasso Regression that controls the strength of the regularization penalty. A larger value of this parameter will result in a stronger penalty, which will encourage the model to use fewer features.\n",

    "    It can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable\n",

    "\n",
    "     It is computationally less expensive than other regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Lasso Regression can select the most important features in the model by shrinking the coefficients of the less important features towards zero. This helps to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "    It can handle missing values in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Lasso Regression is sensitive to the scale of the features, which means that it can give different importance to features based on their scale. To avoid this problem, it is recommended to scale the features before applying Lasso Regression.\n",
